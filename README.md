# Wordle Assistant
---

A React application that helps the user solve [Wordle]("https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html") puzzles. The user enters the feedback (colors) from each Wordle guess, in order to see a filtered list of all remaining words.

## Use

1. **Type or select a word.** You may also click "RANDOM" to select a random word from the list.
2. **Set the color of each letter to match Wordle's output, by clicking them.** Each time you click a letter, its color will change, from gray (letter is not present in solution) to yellow (letter is present, but not in current position) to green (letter is in correct position), and back to gray.
3. **Hit "ENTER" to filter the list of remaining words.** 
4. **Repeat until solved**, or until all six guesses are used.

## Source

The complete 14,855 word list of every word the game will accept as valid can be found in the Wordle client-side JavaScript code. 

However, the set of words from which solutions are drawn is much smaller. With the url "https://www.nytimes.com/svc/wordle/v2/{YYYY}-{MM}-{DD}.json", it is possible to get the solution for a specific date using the NYTimes API. Unfortunately, as of this time (11/28/2022), I can only get solutions as far ahead as 01/07/2023.

Solutions are said to exist for every day through 10/20/2027 ([https://www.cnet.com/culture/how-to-download-wordle-and-play-offline-for-the-next-5-years](https://www.cnet.com/culture/how-to-download-wordle-and-play-offline-for-the-next-5-years)), though.

I am using a much shorter list of 2,315 words, said to be the complete list of solutions. It is sourced from [here](https://github.com/LaurentLessard/wordlesolver/blob/main/solutions_nyt.txt), although the same list can be found in many places around the internet. Apparently, the complete list of solutions used to be defined in the client side code. Since this is no longer the case, I cannot independently verify the authenticity or completeness of this list.
